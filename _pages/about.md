Hi there! My name is Si ("ÊÄù" in Mandarin, [here](https://chinese.yabla.com/chinese-english-pinyin-dictionary.php?define=%E6%80%9D) is how to pronounce it). I am a postdoctoral researcher at the [MRC Integrative Epidemiology Unit (IEU)](https://www.bristol.ac.uk/integrative-epidemiology/) at the University of Bristol, affiliated with both [Programme 1 (Mendelian randomization)](https://www.bristol.ac.uk/integrative-epidemiology/research/mendelian-randomization/) and [Programme 3 (Data mining epidemiological relationships)](https://www.biocompute.org.uk/). Last November, I submitted my PhD thesis titled "Dissecting causal relationships and molecular mechanisms in disease using genetic risk profiles". With an academic background in genetics and genetic epidemiology, my postdoctoral research will focus on triangulating evidence from genetic studies and causal inference analyses, especially for drug target discovery, validation and repurposing. When I'm not doing research, I enjoy travelling, looking at art and nature, and watching/reading science fictions.

Currently, I am conducting a research visit to the [CAUSALab](https://ki.se/en/imm/causalab-at-unit-of-epidemiology-imm-karolinska-institutet-0) at the Karolinsta Institutet (Stockholm, Sweden) under the support of a 6-month Wellcome Trust MGLE PhD Transition Fellowship.
